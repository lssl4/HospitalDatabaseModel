# HospitalDatabaseModel

This project requires me to create database model of the Australian hospital information website for a client. I started producing a UML diagram of the entities and the relationships in regards to the MyHospital website to try to replicate it. I was told to replicate only the two services in the website such as elective surgery and emergency department. This project is only done by me.
